🔬 Lab Work – VM Data Protection (Snapshots, Static IP & Machine Image)

🎯 Objective
Implement VM data protection in Google Cloud by reserving a static IP, creating a machine image, and taking a snapshot for backup/recovery.

🛠️ Steps Performed

## 1. Explored VM Instance Options

🔹Navigated to Compute Engine → VM Instances

🔹Selected VM: test-linux-vm (zone: us-central1-a)

🔹Opened More actions menu → Configure data protection, labels, permissions

## 2. Reserved a Static External IP

🔹Edited VM network settings

🔹Selected Reserve static external IP address

🔹Named it: static-vm-ip

🔹Assigned IP to the VM

## 3. Created a Machine Image

🔹Navigated to Compute Engine → Machine Images

🔹Chose Create machine image

  👉 Entered details:

🔹Name: vm-image-1

🔹Source VM: test-vm

🔹Location: Regional (us-central1)

🔹Clicked Create

## 4. Created a Snapshot

🔹Navigated to Compute Engine → Snapshots

🔹Clicked Create snapshot

  👉Entered details:

🔹Name: snapshot-test

🔹Source disk: test-vm (10GB)

🔹Verified snapshot created (size: ~52 MB)

## 📚 Learning Outcome

🟢 Understood how to protect VM data using Snapshots and Machine Images.

🟢 Learned to reserve a Static External IP for persistent connectivity.

🟢 Gained clarity on when to use Snapshots vs Machine Images.
