To explore and understand the GCP resource hierarchy (Organization → Folders → Projects → Resources) through the GCP Console.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Checked Available Projects**  
   - Navigated to the "Manage Resources" section in GCP Console.  
   - Verified my existing projects, their **Project IDs**, and **Project Numbers**.

2. **Viewed Project Details**  
   - Opened one project and reviewed:
     - Project name  
     - Project ID  
     - Project number  
     - Billing status  

3. **Searched for Organization & Folder Options**  
   - Confirmed that **Organization** and **Folders** are not available in my free-tier account (only starts at project level).

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Learned how GCP organizes resources.
- Understood policy inheritance and billing link at different hierarchy levels.
- Noted that free-tier accounts generally skip the Organization and Folder levels.
