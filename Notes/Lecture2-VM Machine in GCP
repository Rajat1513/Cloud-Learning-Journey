# 📘 Notes – Virtual Machines in GCP

### ☁️ Compute Engine Overview
- GCP’s IaaS offering for creating Virtual Machines (VMs).
- Offers flexibility in machine types, boot disks, zones, and networking.

### 💸 Free Tier
- `e2-micro` machine type is free under the GCP Free Tier.
- Eligible zones: `us-west1`, `us-central1`, and `us-east1`.

### ⚙️ VM Setup Options
- Machine type: `e2-micro` (Free tier)
- OS Image: Debian or Ubuntu (small boot disk)
- Disk: 10 GB standard persistent disk (default)
- Zone: Prefer `us-central1-a` or other free tier zones
- Firewall: Allow HTTP & HTTPS if needed (useful for hosting)

### 🐧 SSH Access
- Use GCP browser-based SSH terminal or third-party tools.
- You don’t need to set a password — keys are managed by GCP.

### 🔒 Firewall
- Optional: Enable HTTP/HTTPS traffic when creating the instance.
- Or manage later in VPC → Firewall Rules.
