## Lecture 9- Google Cloud Storage ☁️

## Introduction 📌
Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a fully managed, scalable, and highly durable **object storage** service.  
It allows storing and retrieving any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere.  
Common use cases: backups, website content, media files, analytics data, and more.

## Key Concepts 🗂️

### 1. Buckets 🪣
- Buckets are the **basic container** in GCS where objects (files) are stored.
- Each bucket has:
  - **Globally unique name** 🌍
  - **Location** (region, dual-region, or multi-region) 📍
  - **Storage class** 🏷️ (Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive)
  - **Access Control** settings 🔐

### 2. Objects 📄
- The files/data stored in GCS are called **Objects**.
- Objects are **immutable** – once uploaded, they cannot be modified, only replaced.
- Metadata (content type, creation date, etc.) is stored along with objects.

### 3. Storage Classes 🏷️
- **Standard** → Frequently accessed data ⚡
- **Nearline** → Data accessed < once per month 📅
- **Coldline** → Data accessed < once per quarter ❄️
- **Archive** → Long-term storage (years) 📦

### 4. Locations 📍
- **Region** → Data stored in a single region (e.g., `us-central1`).
- **Dual-region** → Data replicated across 2 regions.
- **Multi-region** → Data replicated across multiple regions for high availability.

### 5. Access Control 🔑
- Two models:
  - **Uniform bucket-level access** → Permissions applied at bucket level.
  - **Fine-grained access** → Permissions at object level.
- Controlled via **IAM roles** 👥 and **ACLs** 📝.

## Features ⭐
- **Versioning**: Keep multiple versions of an object 🔄
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automate transitions between storage classes or deletion based on conditions ⏳
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted by default (Google-managed or customer-managed keys) 🔒
- **Signed URLs**: Provide temporary access to objects without IAM 🌐

## Use Cases 🚀
- Website hosting 🌍
- Backup and archival 📂
- Big Data analytics input/output storage 📊
- Content delivery for media and apps 🎬
- Disaster recovery storage 🛡️

## Summary 📝
- GCS is **object storage**, not block or file storage.  
- Data is stored in **buckets** and organized as **objects**.  
- Choose storage class & location based on **cost vs access frequency** ⚖️.  
- IAM and ACLs control access to buckets/objects 🔑.  
- GCS integrates with other GCP services like BigQuery, Dataflow, AI/ML 🤖.
