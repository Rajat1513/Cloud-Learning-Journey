# Lecture18 – GCP Cloud Logging and Monitoring. 

##  What Is Covered
This video provides an in-depth explanation of **Cloud Logging** and **Cloud Monitoring** features within the Google Cloud Operations Suite.

##  Cloud Logging
- A centralized logging service for storing, querying, and analyzing log data from applications and infrastructure.
- Features include log ingestion, log-based metrics, and integration with Alerting policies.
- Enables filtering logs by severity, time, resources, or labels.

---

##  Cloud Monitoring
- Designed to collect, visualize, and set alerts on system and application metrics.
- Key capabilities:
  - **Dashboards** to monitor performance, uptime, latency, and more.
  - **Uptime checks** to ensure services are reachable.
  - **Alerting policies** that send notifications based on thresholds or anomalies.

---

##  Features & Interaction
- Seamless integration: Logging feeds metrics used in monitoring.
- Logs-based metrics and monitoring create powerful observability workflows.
- Works with other services like Error Reporting, Trace, Debugger, and more for full-stack visibility.

---

##  Benefits of Logging & Monitoring
- **Operational Visibility**: Quickly identify and investigate issues.
- **Proactive Alerts**: Get notified about incidents before users are impacted.
- **Performance Insights**: Visualize system behavior over time.
- **Compliance and Auditing**: Full log history for auditing and debugging.
