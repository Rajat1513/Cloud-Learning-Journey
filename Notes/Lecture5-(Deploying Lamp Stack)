# Lecture 5 : Deploying A Lamp Stack From Google Cloud Marketplace.


📌 Topic Overview

This video explains how to deploy a full LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) using Google Cloud Marketplace, making it easy to launch a web-ready environment with minimal manual setup.

# 🔑 Key Concepts & Steps

1. Understanding LAMP Stack

 L → Linux (Operating System)

 A → Apache (Web Server)

 M → MySQL (Database)

 P → PHP (Server-side scripting)

👉 This stack is widely used to build and run dynamic web applications.

👉 Marketplace simplifies the setup by offering a pre-configured template with all components.

# 2. Navigating GCP Marketplace

- Open Google Cloud Console → Marketplace

- Search for LAMP (Bitnami)

- Select the solution → Click Launch

# 3. Deployment Configuration

- While deploying, configure:

- Deployment Name

- Region / Zone

- Machine Type (VM resources)

- Firewall Options → Allow HTTP/HTTPS

- Review terms → Click Deploy

# 4. Confirming Deployment

- Wait until the status shows Deployed.

- This confirms VM, database, firewall rules & resources are ready.

# 5. Accessing the Deployed Stack

- Go to Compute Engine → VM Instances

- Find the VM created by Marketplace

- Click SSH to connect to the VM

# 6. Verification with PHP

- Run in SSH terminal:

( sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php' )


- Open External IP/phpinfo.php in a browser

- If PHP info page appears → ✅ Deployment Successful

# ⭐ Takeaway Benefits

⚡ Speed → Launch stack in minutes.

🛠️ Simplicity → Pre-configured setup (OS, web server, DB, networking).

✅ Validation → Use phpinfo() to confirm everything works.
