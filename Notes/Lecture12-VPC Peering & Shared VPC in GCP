# 📒 Notes – VPC Peering & Shared VPC (Video 12)

## 🌐 VPC Peering
- VPC Peering allows **private communication** between two VPC networks.
- Both VPCs can be in the **same project** or **different projects**.
- Benefits:
  - Low-latency, high-bandwidth private communication 🚀
  - No need for external IPs or VPN
- Limitations:
  - Transitive peering is not supported ❌  
    (VPC-A peered with VPC-B, and VPC-B with VPC-C → A cannot talk to C)
  - Duplicate IP ranges are not allowed.

## 🏢 Shared VPC
- Shared VPC lets you **connect resources from multiple projects** to a **common VPC network**.
- One project acts as the **Host Project**:
  - Defines and owns the network.
- Other projects act as **Service Projects**:
  - Their resources (VMs, etc.) use the host project's VPC.
- Advantages:
  - Centralized control 🔑 over networking, security, and routing.
  - Separation of duties → Network admins manage the host project, developers work in service projects.

## 📝 Key Differences
| Feature            | VPC Peering 🌐 | Shared VPC 🏢 |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Scope              | Between 2 VPCs | Multiple projects sharing one VPC |
| IP Overlap         | Not allowed    | Allowed (within host project) |
| Control            | Each project controls own VPC | Centralized network admin control |
| Use Case           | Communication between isolated networks | Large orgs with multiple projects needing a shared network |
