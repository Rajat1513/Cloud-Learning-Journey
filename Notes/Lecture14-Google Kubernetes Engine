# Lecture14 â€“ Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Kubernetes
- Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform**.
- Helps manage containerized applications at scale:
  - Deployment  
  - Scaling  
  - Networking  
  - Load balancing  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Fully managed Kubernetes service** by Google Cloud.
- Automates:
  - Cluster management  
  - Node provisioning  
  - Scaling  
  - Upgrades and repairs  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key GKE Components
1. **Cluster**
   - A cluster is a group of nodes (VMs) managed by Kubernetes.
   - Contains **control plane** + **worker nodes**.

2. **Node**
   - Virtual Machine instance that runs containerized apps.
   - Includes **Kubelet** (agent) + Docker/container runtime.

3. **Pod**
   - Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
   - Can have **one or more containers**.

4. **Deployment**
   - Defines how pods should run (replicas, version, rollout).

5. **Service**
   - Provides networking and load balancing.
   - Types:
     - **ClusterIP** â€“ internal only  
     - **NodePort** â€“ exposed via nodeâ€™s IP  
     - **LoadBalancer** â€“ creates external LB

## ðŸ”¹ Advantages of GKE
- Managed control plane (Google handles upgrades, scaling, patches).  
- Integrated monitoring and logging.  
- High availability across zones.  
- Autopilot mode (Google manages infra completely).  
- Easy integration with CI/CD.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases
- Running **microservices architectures**.  
- Hosting **scalable web apps**.  
- Machine learning workloads.  
- Batch/cron job processing.  
- Hybrid cloud with Anthos.
