# Lecture 16  – GCP BigQuery 

##  What is BigQuery?
- **BigQuery** is Google Cloud’s fully managed, serverless **data warehouse**.
- Designed for running fast, SQL-like analytical queries on large datasets (petabyte scale) without managing infrastructure.

---

##  Key Features
- **Serverless Architecture** – No need for cluster management, auto-scaling built in.
- **Standard SQL Support** – Use SQL queries to analyze structured data efficiently.
- **Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)** – Executes queries across thousands of nodes for speed.
- **Flexible Storage Options** – Separates storage and compute; allows cost optimization.
- **Built-in BI Engine** – Enables fast dashboards and visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Integration** – Use **BigQuery ML** to train and evaluate ML models directly within BigQuery.
- **Data Export & Integration** – Export data easily to Google Cloud Storage or integrate with tools like Dataflow, Data Studio, Sheets.

---

##  Storage Models in BigQuery
- **Native Storage** – Default managed, columnar storage optimized for analytics.
- **External Tables** – Query data stored externally (e.g., in GCS or Cloud Storage) without importing.

---

##  Common Use Cases
- Analyzing **large datasets** (logs, IoT data, marketing data).
- Running **ad-hoc queries** for analytics.
- **Real-time dashboarding** and BI use cases.
- Training and evaluating **ML models** using SQL queries (BigQuery ML).
- Data democratization and **cross-team analytics**.

---

##  Advantages
- Eliminates complexity of infrastructure management.
- High performance with MPP architecture.
- Scales automatically based on query volume.
- Enables powerful analytics and ML workflows within a unified platform.

---

##  Limitations
- **Cost** can escalate with frequent or complex queries; use cost control features and query optimization.
- Not ideal for **transactional** (OLTP) workloads.
- Query performance depends heavily on **data design, partitioning, and clustering.**

---

##  Summary
BigQuery is a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective solution for big data analytics.  
Whether you're performing ad-hoc queries, building dashboards, or running in-database ML models, BigQuery simplifies and accelerates your data workflows.
