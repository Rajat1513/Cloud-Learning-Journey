# Lecture 6 – Managed Instance Groups (MIG) in Google Cloud.

## 📌 Overview  
In this video, we learned about **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)** in Google Cloud.  
MIGs help us run multiple **identical VM instances** as a single unit. They provide **autoscaling, self-healing, and load balancing** features to ensure that applications remain available and scalable without manual intervention.

## 📝 Key Concepts  

1. **Managed Instance Group (MIG)**  
   - A collection of VM instances created from the same **instance template**.  
   - Ensures uniformity – all VMs in the group have the same configuration.  
   - Can automatically add/remove instances based on demand.  

2. **Unmanaged Instance Group** (for comparison)  
   - Collection of VMs with different configurations.  
   - Does not support autoscaling or automatic updates.  

3. **Why MIG?**  
   - High availability.  
   - Automatic scaling up/down based on load.  
   - Self-healing (recreates unhealthy instances).  
   - Works well with **load balancers**.

## ⚙️ Steps Shown in the Video  

1. **Create an Instance Template**  
   - Define machine type, boot disk, image, firewall rules, etc.  
   - This template acts as the "blueprint" for all instances in the MIG.  

2. **Create a Managed Instance Group**  
   - Navigate to **Compute Engine → Instance Groups**.  
   - Choose **New Managed Instance Group**.  
   - Provide:
     - Group name & region/zone.  
     - The instance template created earlier.  
     - Initial number of VM instances.  

3. **Enable Autoscaling**  
   - Choose metric (e.g., **CPU utilization 60%**).  
   - Define min/max number of instances.  
   - MIG will automatically add/remove VMs based on the workload.  

4. **Health Checks & Self-Healing**  
   - Attach a health check.  
   - MIG automatically replaces unhealthy or failed VMs.  

5. **(Optional) Load Balancer Integration**  
   - MIGs can be attached to a load balancer.  
   - Ensures traffic is evenly distributed across all healthy instances.

## ✅ Key Takeaways  

- MIGs = **scalable + reliable infrastructure**.  
- Autoscaling saves cost by **adding instances only when needed**.  
- Health checks ensure **uninterrupted services** by replacing failed instances.  
- Ideal for production workloads like **web servers, APIs, and microservices**.

## 📖 Example Use Case  
Imagine you’re running an **e-commerce website**:  
- During normal hours → 2–3 VMs handle traffic.  
- During sales or festivals → MIG automatically adds more VMs to handle high load.  
- If one VM crashes → MIG replaces it automatically.  
- A load balancer ensures users are directed to the nearest healthy instance.

## 🎯 Conclusion  
Managed Instance Groups are one of the **core building blocks** of scalable architecture in Google Cloud.  
They reduce operational overhead by automating scaling and healing, ensuring your applications stay **reliable, available, and cost-efficient**.
