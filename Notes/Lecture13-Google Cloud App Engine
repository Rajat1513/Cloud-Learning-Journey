# 📘 Lecture13 – Google App Engine (Video 13)

## 🌍 What is Google App Engine?
- Google App Engine (GAE) is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** offering in GCP.  
- It allows developers to **build, deploy, and scale applications** without managing infrastructure.  
- Focus is on **code**, while Google handles servers, scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.  

---

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Serverless platform** → no need to manage VMs or OS.  
- **Automatic scaling** based on incoming traffic.  
- **Multiple runtimes supported** → Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Go, Ruby, .NET, etc.  
- **Built-in security** (Google-managed firewalls, IAM, SSL).  
- **Versioning** → deploy multiple versions and easily rollback.  
- **Traffic splitting** between app versions for testing.  
- **Integration with other GCP services** like Firestore, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub.

## 🏗️ Components of App Engine
1. **Application** – Top-level container for all services.  
2. **Services** – Logical components of the app (e.g., frontend, backend).  
3. **Versions** – Each deployment creates a new version of a service.  
4. **Instances** – Compute resources running each version (auto-scaled).  

---

## ⚡ Scaling Types
- **Automatic Scaling** – Based on request load.  
- **Basic Scaling** – Starts instances on demand and stops when idle.  
- **Manual Scaling** – Fixed number of instances.  

---

## 📂 app.yaml File
Configuration file required for each service.  
Defines runtime, instance class, scaling type, environment variables, etc.  

**Example:**
```yaml
runtime: python39
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app

🚀 Deployment

- Deploy using Cloud Shell / gcloud CLI:

( gcloud app deploy )


- After deployment → App is available on a public URL like:


🔑 Benefits of App Engine

- No infra management → just focus on coding.

- Auto-scaling saves cost during low traffic.

- Supports CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

- Secure and highly available (Google manages redundancy).

- Easy rollback with versioning.

⚠️ Limitations

- Limited flexibility compared to Compute Engine / Kubernetes.

- Vendor lock-in (tightly bound with Google infra).

- Not suitable for apps needing custom OS/kernel level control.

✅ Summary

** Google App Engine is ideal for developers who want to deploy apps quickly with minimal ops overhead.
It’s great for startups, prototypes, and scalable web apps. **
