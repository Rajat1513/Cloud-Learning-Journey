# Lecture10 - ☁️ Google Cloud Persistent Disk (Block Storage).

## 📌 What is Persistent Disk (PD)?  
- Persistent Disk is a **durable block storage solution** provided by Google Cloud.  
- It can be **attached to VM instances** and behaves like a physical hard drive.  
- Data persists even after VM stops or restarts.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features  
- **Durable & Reliable** – Data is replicated across multiple locations within a zone.  
- **Scalable** – Resize disks without downtime.  
- **Types of Persistent Disks**:  
  - Standard PD (HDD) – cost-effective, good for sequential access.  
  - SSD PD – high performance, low latency.  
  - Extreme PD – very high IOPS, for specialized workloads.  
- **Regional PD** – Replicated across two zones in the same region for high availability.

## ⚙️ Use Cases  
- Running databases (needs reliable block storage).  
- Applications requiring **consistent & fast I/O performance**.  
- Backup & restore operations.  

---

## 🔄 Snapshots & Backups  
- Persistent Disks support **snapshots** for backups.  
- Snapshots are **incremental** – only changes are saved, reducing cost.  
- Snapshots can be used to create **new disks** quickly.  

---

## 🔐 Security  
- All Persistent Disks are **encrypted by default**.  
- Users can also provide their own **encryption keys (CMEK)**.  

---

## 📝 Summary  
- Persistent Disk = **Google Cloud’s block storage service**.  
- Flexible, durable, and scalable storage for VM instances.  
- Supports backups, snapshots, and encryption for data safety.
