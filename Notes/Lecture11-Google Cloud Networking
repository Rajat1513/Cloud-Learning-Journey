## 📒 Lecture-11 (GCP Networking | VPC)

# 🌐 What is a VPC?

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) → Private, isolated virtual network inside Google Cloud.

- Provides networking, IP allocation, routing, firewall rules, and connectivity.

- Every project has a default VPC (but in production, custom VPCs are preferred).

## 🛠️ VPC Modes

# 1. Auto Mode

- Subnets are automatically created in each region.

- Predefined IP ranges.

- Easier for beginners, but less control.

# 2. Custom Mode

- No automatic subnets.

- You manually define subnets, IP ranges, firewall rules.

- Preferred for production as it gives fine-grained control.

## 📍 Key Components of VPC

- Subnets → Logical subdivisions of IP ranges (regional, not global).

- Firewall Rules → Control traffic in & out of VPC.

- Routes → Define traffic flow between subnets or to the internet.

- Peering → Connect VPCs privately across projects/orgs.

- Shared VPC → Multiple projects share the same VPC network.

## 🔑 Important Points

- VPC is global but subnets are regional.

- IP ranges: private (RFC1918) or custom.

- Default VPC comes with auto subnets + default firewall rules.

- For production: always create a Custom VPC for better security & management.
