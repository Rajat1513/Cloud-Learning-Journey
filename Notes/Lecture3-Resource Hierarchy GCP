# Day 3 – GCP Resource Hierarchy: Organizations, Projects, and Folders

## 📌 Overview
In Google Cloud, resources are arranged in a hierarchy for better management, access control, and billing tracking.

The hierarchy is:

Organization → Folder(s) → Project(s) → Resources


---

## 🏢 Organization
- Represents the **root node** in the GCP resource hierarchy.
- Usually linked to a **Google Workspace (G Suite)** or **Cloud Identity** account.
- Every resource in the organization inherits policies from here.
- **Free tier personal accounts** often do not have an Organization node.

**Example:** A company like "TechCorp Pvt Ltd".

---

## 📂 Folder
- **Optional** grouping mechanism between Organization and Projects.
- Helps organize projects based on **departments, teams, or environments**.
- Policies applied to a folder are inherited by all projects inside it.
- Requires an Organization to exist.

**Example:** Departments like "DevOps Team", "Finance", "R&D".

---

## 📁 Project
- **Mandatory** container for resources.
- Each project has:
  - **Project Name** – human-readable name.
  - **Project ID** – unique, permanent identifier for APIs & billing.
  - **Project Number** – system-generated numeric ID.
- Billing, IAM permissions, and quotas are managed at the project level.

**Example:** "Website Deployment", "Data Analytics Pipeline".

---

## 📊 Real-World Analogy
- **Organization** = Company HQ.
- **Folder** = Departments inside the company.
- **Project** = Specific work or client project handled by a department.
- **Resources** = Employees, tools, and assets used for that project.

---

## 🔍 Key Points
- Every GCP resource must belong to a project.
- Policies flow **top-down** (Organization → Folder → Project → Resource).
- You can have multiple projects under one billing account.
- Free tier accounts usually start at the **Project** level.
